# DataScienceCompetiton(Stemfellowsip)
This project was created for the data science competition held by Stemfellowship in Canada, where I used 699 samples of benign and malignant tumors from Kaggle. The sample contains nine features: mitosis, nuclioli, nulcei, cell size and shape, clump size, adhesion,single epitheloa cell size, and chromatin.

This project is composed of four parts: data collection, data cleaning, visualization of the variables, and creating five machine learning models.

Data Cleaning : After checking Null values the values have been replaced with mean vlaues since the dataset is small and not categoriscal. Then the most and least two importnat features or dependent variables have been investiagted.

Data Visualzation: The relationshio between the varaibles have been exlpored through craeting violin lpot, heatmap, and pair plot.
